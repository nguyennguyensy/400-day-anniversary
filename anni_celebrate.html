        Dear my love, <br /><br />
        Today is our 400-day anniversary. It has been a true bless to have you here.<br />
        Even though sometimes we argue and sometimes we fight, I know for sure we will never leave the other one.<br />
        From the bottom of my heart, I just want to say I love you! <br />
        Wish us all the best and wish that we will always be together and for the other.<br /><br />
    </a>
